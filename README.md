Create a C# console application for a bakery that includes the following functionality:

There should be two classes: one for Bread and one for Pastry.

When the user runs the application, they should receive a prompt with a welcome message along with the cost for both Bread and Pastry.

A user should be able to specify how many loaves of Bread and how many Pastrys they'd like.

The application will return the total cost of the order.

Pierre offers the following deal for Bread: Buy 2, get 1 free. A single loaf costs $5, then:

two loaves costs $10
three loaves cost $10
four loaves costs $15
five loaves cost $20
six loaves costs $20
seven loaves cost $25
Can you see a pattern? Every 3rd loaf of bread is free.
Pierre offers the following deal for Pastry: Buy 3, get 1 free. A single pastry costs $2, then:

two pastries costs $4
three pastries costs $6
four pastries costs $6
five pastries costs $8
six pastries costs $10
seven pastries costs $12
eight pastries costs $12
Can you see a pattern? Every 4th pastry is free.
All functionality for the business logic models should be tested.
